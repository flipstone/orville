# This script will run compile and run the tests against all the
# stack*.yml files that are found in the root of the repo, reporting
# whether each one passed or failed.
#
# It is generally useful for doing a final check before pushing, rather
# then as the regular edit/compile/test loop to get feedback during
# development.
#
# You can run it via docker by running:
#   docker-compose run --rm dev ./test-all
#

rm -rf test-all-logs

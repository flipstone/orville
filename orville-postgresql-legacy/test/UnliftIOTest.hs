   This cannot be derived because 'ThirdPartyMonad' does not implement
   'MonadOrvilleControl'. Declaring an empty instance is trivial, however, and
   avoids having to provide an orphan instance of 'MonadOrvilleControl' for
   'ThirdPartyMonad'.

   If the user is using 'MonadUnliftIO', then it would be up to them to provide
   this instance for their own Monad. Later versions of UnliftIO provide a helper
   function for implementing this, but we would like to keep the dependency bounds
   as broad as possibly, so we can't use that helper here.

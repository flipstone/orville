  # lts-8.24 contains tasty-discover-1.1.0 for some reason, which appears to
  # have an issuee with tests having the same name if different test modules,
  # so we use a different version of tasty-discover to run tests in this lts.
  # This doesn't affect the operation of the library itself, which does not
  # depend on tasty.

{-|
  A 'Plan' is an executable set of queries that can be executed to load data
  from the database, using the results of prior queries as input parameters to
  following queries in controlled ways. In particular, the "controlled" aspect
  of this allows plans that take a single input to be adapted to take multiple
  input parameters in a list without the resulting plan executing N+1 queries.
  This restriction means that while query results can be used as input
  parameters to later queries, they cannot be used to decide to run completely
  different queries based on other query results. Allowing this would prevent
  the 'Plan' structure from eliminating N+1 query loops.

  Note that during execution queries are never combined across tables to form
  joins or subqueries. Queries are still executed in the same sequence as
  specified in the plan, just on all the inputs at once rather than in a loop.
  If you need to do a join with a plan, you can always construction your
  own custom 'Op.Operation' and use 'planOperation' to incorporate into a plan.

  The @param@ type variable indicates what type of value is expected as input
  when the plan is executed.

  The @result@ type for a plan indicates what Haskell type is produced
  when the plan is executed.

  The @scope@ type is used internally by Orville to track the plan is currently
  executed against a single input or multiple inputs. This type parameter
  should never specified as a concrete type in user code, but must be exposed
  as a variable to ensure that execute scope is tracked correctly through
  usages of 'bind'.

{-|
  A 'Planned' value is a wrapper around the results of previous run queries
  when using the 'bind' function. At the time that you are writing a plan you
  do not know whether the 'Plan' will be run with a single input or multiple
  inputs. A 'Planned' value may end up being either an individual item or a
  list of items. Due to this, your ability to interact with the value is
  limited to the use of 'fmap' to extract (or build) other values from the
  results. 'Planned' values can be used together with the 'use' function to
  make a 'Plan' that produces the extracted value.

  Note that while 'Planned' could provide an 'Applicative' instance as well, it
  does not to avoid confusion with 'Applicative' instance for 'Plan' itself.
  If you need to build a value from several 'Planned' values using
  'Applicative', you should call 'use' on each of the values and use the
  'Applicative' instance for 'Plan'.

  be a row found matching the plan's input value. If no row is found an
  'Op.AssertionFailed' exception will be thrown. This is a useful convenience
  when looking up foreign-key associations that are expected to be enforced
  by the database itself.

{-|
  'planMany' adapts a plan that takes a single input parameter to work on
  multiple input parameters. When the new plan is executed each query will
  execute in the same basic order, but with adjusted conditions to find all the
  rows for all inputs at once rather than running the planned queries once for
  each input.

  'focusParam' builds a plan from a function and an existing plan taking the
  result of that function as input. This is especially useful when there is some
  structure, and a plan that only needs a part of that structure as input. The
  function argument can access part of the structure for the plan argument to use,
  so the final returned plan can take the entire structure as input.

{-|
  'planEither' lets you construct a plan that branches by executing a different
  plan for the 'Left' and 'Right' sides of an 'Either' value. When used with a
  single input parameter only one of the two plans will be used, based on the
  input parameter. When used on multiple input parameters, each of the two
  plans will be executed only once with all the 'Left' and 'Right' values
  provided as input parameters respectively.
-}
planEither :: (forall leftScope. Plan leftScope leftParam leftResult)
           -> (forall rightScope. Plan rightScope rightParam rightResult)
           -> Plan scope (Either leftParam rightParam) (Either leftResult rightResult)
planEither =
  PlanEither

{-|
  'planMaybe' lifts a plan so both its param and result become 'Maybe's. This is
  useful when modifying an existing plan to deal with optionality. Writing just
  one plan can then easily produce both the required and optional versions.
-}
planMaybe :: (forall s. Plan s a b) -> Plan scope (Maybe a) (Maybe b)
planMaybe plan =
  focusParam (maybe (Left ()) Right) $
    either id id <$> planEither (pure Nothing) (Just <$> plan)

{-|
  'bind' gives access to the results of a plan to use as input values to future
  plans. The plan result is given the input parameter to the provided function,
  which must produce the remaining 'Plan' to be executed. The value will be
  wrapped in the 'Planned' type, which may represent either a result or
  multiple results, depending on whether one plan is currently be executed with
  one and multiple input parameters. This ensures that the caller produces only
  a single remaining 'Plan' to be used for all inputs when there are multiple
  to eliminate the need to possibly run different queries for different inputs
  (which would an introduce N+1 query execution).

  The 'Planned' value (or values) provided by 'bind' have actually been
  retrieved from the database, so the value can be used multiple times when
  constructing the remaining 'Plan' without fear of causing the query to run
  multiple times.

  Also see 'use' for how to lift a 'Planned' value back into a 'Plan'.

{-|
  'assert' allows you to make an assertion about a plans result that will throw
  an 'Op.AssertionFailed' failed exception during execution if it proves to be
  false. The first parameter is the assertion function, which should return
  either an error message to be given in the exception or the value to be used
  as the plan's result.

  'execute' accepts the input parameter (or parameters) expected by a 'Plan'
  and runs the plan to completion, either throwing an 'Op.AssertionFailed'

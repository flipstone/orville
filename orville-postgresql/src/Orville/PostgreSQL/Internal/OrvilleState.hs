  Registers a callback to be invoked during transactions.

  The callback given will be called after the SQL statement corresponding
  to the given event has finished executing. Callbacks will be called
  in the order the are added.

  Note: There is no specialized error handling for these callbacks. This means
  that if a callback raises an exception no further callbacks will be called
  and the exception will propagate up until it caught elsewhere. In particular,
  if an exception is raised by a callback upon opening the transaction it will
  cause the transaction to be rolled-back the same as any other exception that
  might happen during the transaction. In general, we recommend only using
  callbacks that either raise no exceptions or can handle their own exceptions
  cleanly.

  Adds a callback to be called when an Orville operation executes a SQL
  statement. The callback is given the IO action that will perform the
  query execution and must call that action for the query to be run.
  In particular, you can use this to time query and log any that are slow.

  Calls to any previously added callbacks will also be execute as part of
  the IO action passed to the new callback. Thus the newly added callback
  happens "around" the previously added callback.

  There is no special exception handling done for these callbacks beyond what
  they implement themelves. Any callbacks should allow for the possibility that
  the IO action they are given may raise an exception.

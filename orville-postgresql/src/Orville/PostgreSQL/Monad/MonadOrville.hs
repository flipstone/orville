  'MonadOrville' is the typeclass that most Orville operations require to
  do anything that connects to the database. 'MonadOrville' itself is empty,
  but it lists all the required typeclasses as superclass contraints so that
  it can be used instead of listing all the constraints on every function.

  If you want to be able to run Orville operations directly in your own
  application's Monad stack, a good starting place is to add

  @
    instance MonadOrville MyApplicationMonad
  @

  to your module and then let the compiler tell you what instances you
  are missing from the superclasses.

  'MonadOrvilleControl' presents the interface that Orville will used to
  lift low-level IO operations that cannot be lifted via 'liftIO' (i.e.
  those where the IO parameter is contravriant rather than covariant).

  For application monads built using only 'ReaderT' and 'IO', this can be
  trivially implemented (or derived), using the 'ReaderT' instance that is
  provided here. If you monad stack is sufficiently complicated, you may
  need to use the 'unliftio' package as a stepping stone to implementing
  'MonadOrvilleControl'. If your monad uses features that 'unliftio' cannot
  support (e.g. the State monad or continuations), then you may need to
  use 'monad-control' instead.

  See 'Orville.PostgreSQL.UnliftIO' for functions that can be used as the
  implementation of the methods below for monads that implement
  'MonadUnliftIO'.

  'withConnection' should be used to receive a 'Connection' handle for
  executing queries against the database from within an application monad using
  Orville.  For the "outermost" call of 'withConnection', a connection will be
  acquired from the resource pool. Additional calls to 'withConnection' that
  happen inside the 'm a' that uses the connection will return the same
  'Connection' the same connection. When the 'm a' finishes the connection
  will be returned to the pool. If 'm a' throws an exception the pool's
  exception handling will take effect, generally destroying the connection in
  case it was the source of the error.

  'withConnection_' is a convenience version of 'withConnection' for those that
  don't need the actual connection handle. You might want to use this function
  even without using the handle because it ensures that all the Orville
  operations performed by the action passed to it occur on the same connection.
  Orville uses connection pooling, so unless you use either 'withConnection' or
  'withTransaction' each database operation may be performed on a different
  connection.

to ensure some Haskell action occurs within a database transaction.

  Performs an action in an Orville monad within a database transaction. The transaction
  in begun before the action is called. If the action completes without raising an exception,
  the transaction will be committed. If the action raises an exception, the transaction will
  rollback.

  This function in safe to call from within another transaction. When called this way the
  transaction will establish a new savepoint at the beginning of the nested transaction and
  either release the savepoint or rollback to it as appropriate.

  Note: Exceptions are handled using the implementations of 'Monad.catch' and
  'Monad.mask'  provided by the 'MonadOrvilleControl' instance for @m@.

  INTERNAL: Constructs a savepoint name based on the current nesting level of
  transactions, as tracked by the `OrvilleState.Savepoint` type. Strictly
  speaking this is not necessary for PostgreSQL because it supports shadowing
  savepoint names. The SQL standard doesn't allow for savepoint name shadowing,
  however. Re-using this same name in other databases would overwrite the
  savepoint rather than shadow it. This function constructs savepoint names
  that will work on any database that implements savepoints accordings to the
  SQL standard even though Orville only supports PostgreSQL currently.

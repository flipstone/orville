Functions for working with executable @DELETE@ statements. The 'Delete' type is
a value that can be passed around and executed later. The 'Delete' is directly
associated with the presence of a returning clause and how to decode any rows
returned by that clause. This means it can be safely executed via
'executeDelete' or 'executeDeleteReturning' as appropriate. It is a lower-level
API than the entity delete functions in
"Orville.PostgreSQL.Execution.EntityOperations", but not as primitive as
"Orville.PostgreSQL.Expr.Delete".

{- |
  Builds a 'Delete' that will execute the specified query and use the given
  'SqlMarshaller' to decode it. It is up to the caller to ensure that the given
  'Expr.DeleteExpr' makes sense and returns a result that the 'SqlMarshaller'
  can decode.

  This is the lowest level of escape hatch available for 'Delete'. The caller can build any query
  that Orville supports using the expression building functions, or use @RawSql.fromRawSql@ to build
  a raw 'Expr.DeleteExpr'. It is expected that the 'ReturningOption' given matches the
  'Expr.DeleteExpr'. This level of interface does not provide an automatic enforcement of the
  expectation, however failure is likely if that is not met.

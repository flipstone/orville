 'executeRaw' runs a given SQL statement returning the raw underlying result.

 All handling of stepping through the result set is left to the caller.  This
 potentially leaves connections open much longer than one would expect if all
 of the results are not iterated through immediately *and* the data copied.

  'close' has many subtleties to it.

  First note that async exceptions are masked.  'mask' though, only works for
  things that are not interruptible
  <https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.15/base-4.13.0.0/Control-Exception.html#g:13>

  From the previous link, 'tryTakeMVar' is not interruptible, where 'takeMVar'
  *is*.  So by using 'tryTakeMVar' along with 'mask', we should be safe from
  async exceptions causing us to not finish an underlying connection.  Notice
  that the only place the MVar is ever taken is here so 'tryTakeMVar' gives us
  both the non-blocking semantics to protect from async exceptions with 'mask'
  _and_ should never truly return an empty unless two threads were racing to
  close the connection, in which case.. one of them will close the connection.

    underlyingFinish restore = do
      underlyingConnection <- tryTakeMVar handle'
      restore (traverse LibPQ.finish underlyingConnection)
  in
    void $ mask underlyingFinish

{- |
 'underlyingExecute' is the internal, primitive execute function.

  This is not intended to be directly exposed to end users, but instead wrapped
  in something using a pool.  Note there are potential dragons here in that
  this calls `tryReadMvar` and then returns an error if the MVar is not full.
  The intent is to never expose the ability to empty the `MVar` outside of this
  module, so unless a connection has been closed it *should* never be empty.
  And a connection should be closed upon removal from a resource pool (in which
  case it can't be used for this  function in the first place).

  Escapes and quotes a string for use as a literal within a SQL command that
  will be execute on the given connection. This uses the @PQescapeStringConn@
  function from libpq, which takes the character encoding of the connection
  into account. Not that while @PQescapeStringConn@ does not surround the
  literal with quotes, this function does for the sake of symmetry with
  'quoteIdentifier'.

  This function returns a `BSB.Buider` so that the result can be included in
  a builder being constructed for the surrounding SQL command without making
  an additional copy of the `BS.Bytestring` returned by LibPQ for the sake of
  adding the surrounding quotes.

  Escapes and quotes a string for use as an identifier within a SQL command
  that will be execute on the given connection. This uses the
  @PQescapeIdentifier@ function from libpq, which takes the character encoding
  of the connection into account and also applies the quotes.

  Although this function does not need to copy the `BS.ByteString` returned by
  LibPQ to add the quotes (since LibPQ already added them), it returns a
  `BSB.Builder` nonetheless to maintain symmetry with `quoteStringLiteral`.

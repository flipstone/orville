  'close' has many subtleties to it.

  First note that async exceptions are masked.  'mask' though, only works for
  things that are not interruptible
  <https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.15/base-4.13.0.0/Control-Exception.html#g:13>

  From the previous link, 'tryTakeMVar' is not interruptible, where @takeMVar@
  *is*.  So by using 'tryTakeMVar' along with 'mask', we should be safe from
  async exceptions causing us to not finish an underlying connection.  Notice
  that the only place the close lock MVar is ever taken is here so
  'tryTakeMVar' gives us both the non-blocking semantics to protect from async
  exceptions with 'mask' _and_ should never truly return an empty unless two
  threads were racing to close the connection, in which case.. one of them will
  close the connection.

  Escapes and quotes a string for use as a literal within a SQL command that

  function from LibPQ, which takes the character encoding of the connection
  into account. Note that while @PQescapeStringConn@ does not surround the
  literal with quotes, this function does for the sake of symmetry with
  'quoteIdentifier'.

  This function returns a `BSB.Builder` so that the result can be included in
  a builder being constructed for the surrounding SQL command without making
  an additional copy of the `BS.ByteString` returned by LibPQ for the sake of
  adding the surrounding quotes.

  Escapes and quotes a string for use as an identifier within a SQL command

# The fpco.list apt source was causing an error build:
#   E: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/https could not be found.
#
# The docker image above is no longer officially supported. Probably FPCO
# switched to https for their apt repo and put a redirect in place, but the
# base docker image does not have the apt https driver installed to handle that
# redirect. Since we expect the `0.9_development` branch to replace master, I've
# simply removed the offending file from the apt sources below.
